### Components

    This folder holds special building blocks for our application's interface. Each component represents a distinct part of our app's user interface, like buttons, forms, headers, or entire sections of a webpage. They're designed to be reusable, which means we can use them in different parts of our app without rewriting code, helping us maintain consistency and save time.

        Example: components/header.vue with Ant Design (antd) integration.

### Router

    The router folder manages how users navigate through our application. It ensures that when users click on links or enter URLs, they see the correct content. Think of it as a map that guides users from one page to another, making sure they always find what they're looking for in our app.

        Examples:
        router/user/Home/index.js
        router/private.route.js

### Services

    This folder houses functions that help our app communicate with other services or data sources, like databases or web servers. These functions handle tasks such as fetching data, sending information, or performing calculations. By organizing them here, we keep our code neat and make it easier to maintain and update.

        Examples:
        services/User/index.services.js

### Stores

    The stores folder handles the storage and management of data that multiple parts of our app need to access. It uses powerful tools like Vuex and Pinia to maintain this shared information in a centralized way. This ensures that all parts of our app stay in sync and display the correct data, enhancing reliability and performance.

        Example: store/module/auth.js with Pinia and Vuex integration.

### Utils

    This folder contains small, helpful functions that perform specific tasks across our entire project. These functions aren't tied to any particular part of our app but are used wherever they're needed. They can range from formatting dates to validating user inputs, making our codebase more efficient and easier to work with.

         Examples:
         utils/common.utils.js
         utils/i18n.js
         utils/logger.js

### Views

    The views folder contains the main pages and screens that users interact with in our application. Each view represents a distinct section or feature of our app, such as a homepage, login page, user profile page, or settings screen. Views are where the components come together to create a complete user experience, allowing users to navigate and interact with our app's functionality.

        Example: views/Login.vue
